Okay, let's roll!

In RStudio: `File > New File > Shiny App Web`

Create a name in `Application Name` and click on `Create`

This is what to see, right?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.
#
# Find out more about building applications with Shiny here:

library(shiny)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
   
   # Application title
   titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
   
   # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
   sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
         sliderInput("bins",
                     "Number of bins:",
                     min = 1,
                     max = 50,
                     value = 30)
      ),
      
      # Show a plot of the generated distribution
      mainPanel(
         plotOutput("distPlot")
      )
   )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
   
   output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
      # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
      x    <- faithful[, 2] 
      bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
      
      # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
      hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
   })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Click on `Knit`

You see this now, correct?

Excellent! 

You have built your first Shiny app! And perhaps your first -- of many -- web apps, right?

***

Let's now show your great work to the world! 

More information on how to deploy your app to the web [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/)

***

`Sign up` to `shinyapps.io` if you do not have an account yet.

***

Log in and follow the three steps:

i) Install 'rsconnect' `install.packages('rsconnect')`
ii) Authorize Account
iii) Deploy

***

If you run into error messages like this

`Error in library(...) : there is no package called ...`

Just install `install.packages()` the package `R` is asking you 
and make it available using `library()`

Wait for a few seconds... VoilÃ !

Your app is up and running: `https://argosms.shinyapps.io/shiny_tutorial/` for the world to see!

### Challenge 1

in `app.R`: What is `ui`? What is `server`?

***

### Challenge 2

in `app.R`, under `sliderInput`: play with the numbers in `min` `max` `value`

then `save` and click on `Run app`. Can you see the changes?

***

### Challenge 3

Add a [widget](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html) to your app.
**Hint**: think about `input` and `output`
