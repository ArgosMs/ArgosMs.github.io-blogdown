Hi! My codename is 'ArgosMs'. This is the closest I have ever got to become a super hero!

I have been on the road for a while. Born and raised in the hyper megalopolis of [Sao Paulo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwcUdMo3R4) but actually the product of war and poverty (so I am a loose end of sheer luck, *I guess*). 

"オバチアン" and "オディチアン" fled poverty in [Okinawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPzf2UlvqK4) and "Babcia" and "дідусь" reconnected with [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXnstmYu5nM) communities in southern Brazil after running for their lives in Eastern Europe.  

Backpacked on a shoestring all over [South America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R35URiT_fm8) and [Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWydEjyNsQY). Tried not to get killed snowboarding in [British Columbia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVfpfzcIBZs) and [California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVA9fma3wq8). Survived kitesurfing at scorching [beaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te9YZsltyGY).

Humbled by many ocean-sun-rise-set in [Hawaii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih_Q4wj9Log) while also mingling with some of the most amazing people from [Oceania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDmGM1UEWzI).

Fell in love, literally, with [Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccupD_IIN1U). Felt at home across [Southeast Asia's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyEd6QBSgat5kkC6svyjudA) food markets. Eclipsed by [aurora borealis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6CIjWpd3bE). 

Had a blast in [Oz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACVBan55U1U), where I also mastered the art of [standing nappy changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2WtGd9W-co).

And now in [Howdy land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlFD0Zyl_f0) getting ready for our next adventure! Cheers,
