All of us hate something, which is fairly acceptable behavior. When it comes to ‘hate speech’, though, if you venture to discuss it with people with legal background some say that ‘hate speech’ is juridically protected whether others would vehemently disagree. I am not getting into this heated, but very important, debate as this is far from the purpose of this blog. However, I do agree that ‘hate speech’ needs to be monitored and mitigated if it is proven that they encourage or lead to civil wrong doings and, even worse, criminal [actions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2cca6fef0750). In the context of this blog then I do not want see people killing Excel followers just because of their extreme passion for `.xml` spreadsheets. Do not get me wrong, Excel can be a great ‘guru’ for what it is [intended to](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-microsoft-excel-3573533) but even so it is an outdated piece of software, which has now been slowly and gradually been replaced by [RMarkdown](https://vimeo.com/178485416), a program that is more adequate for data communication and visualization.

Before we get into the tenet of this blog, let’s contextualize the ‘hate speech’ towards Excel bit more. This contextualization after all helps us more accurately grasp the possibilities offered by RMarkdown. First off, it is important to highlight that hate towards Excel spreadsheets feature different facets. Some people say that working with `.xml` files is too time consuming and [redundant](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/5ygmb1/i_fuckin_hate_excel/) tasks. Other haters would point to the fact that it is inherently [error-prone](https://www.insightsquared.com/2013/12/why-excel-spreadsheets-are-actually-the-worst/). Some would argue that Excel is just not a good fit to this era of [big data](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/06/16/spreadsheet-reporting-5-reasons-why-it-is-bad-for-business/#52e71ecf65e3) analytics. There is also this guy who argues that Excel could even explode, financially, the [planet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/02/13/microsofts-excel-might-be-the-most-dangerous-software-on-the-planet/#7079a52633dc). And finally there are those who blame their [universities](http://www.arikhanson.com/2014/10/01/why-do-pr-people-hate-excel-so-much/) for not being ahead of their time and thus failling to prepare graduates for the job market (Hey, this person seems actually to like `.xml` while also pointing out the underlying reasons why future graduates may end up hating `.Rmd`). For all those people feeling deeply affected from these ‘hate’ comments, because of organization’s  unconditional love to norms, rules, and traditions, I may humbly recommend two remedies: you either take this [holistic](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/272138) pieces of advice or start using RMarkdown.

RMarkdown is an *R* package that combines narratives, codes and appealing visual outputs. In few words, it allows you to have more control over your work, be more efficient (sleeping more and better is very important!), and share in just few clicks, and lines of code, a compelling story for all the hard work you have put in (at least this is what you want everybody to think of you, right?). Well, as RStudio is not paying me to write this blog, so I will keep it brief about the main reasons why you should start saving your files as `.Rmd`. This [blog](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/05/16/replacing-excel-reports-with-r-markdown-and-shiny/) provides a good summary and overview of these reasons and this [one](https://community.rstudio.com/t/convince-me-to-start-using-r-markdown/1636/16) is a nice thread, also less commercialized and perhaps more convincing list of arguments, of personal accounts featuring RMarkdown experiences. You may read them if you want to be convinced. 

Assuming that you now have a better idea of what RMarkdown is, you may want now some direction to start playing with it. If you are the type of person who learns by listening short lectures, you may like this intro [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNS7i2m4sB0). If reading is enough for you to grasp new concepts but still require something a bit more comprehensive, these initial [instructions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-formats.html) or these [ones](https://kbroman.org/datacarpentry_R_2018-06-04/04-rmarkdown.html) might be just what you are looking for. And here is a practical [example](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/fancifying-excel-tables-in-r-markdown-with-kable-extra/) of how you start using RMarkdown right from your Excel files (I have a hunch that university instructors would particularly enjoy this blog). Finally RMarkdown, and its [variation](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/create-and-format-word-documents-using-r-software-and-reporters-package), has also more recently been sold as a [replacement](https://magesblog.com/post/2014-08-05-thanks-to-r-markdown-perhaps-word-is/) for Microsoft Word (I am positive you have also thought about that while reading this blog). This is an interesting topic to cover in a next post.
