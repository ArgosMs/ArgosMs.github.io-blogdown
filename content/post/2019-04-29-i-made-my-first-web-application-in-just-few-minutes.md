Excellent! 

You have built your first Shiny app! The first of your many web apps, right?

***

Let's now show your great work to the world! 

More information on how to deploy your app to the web [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/).

***

`Sign up` to `shinyapps.io` if you do not have an account yet.

***

Log in and follow the three steps:

i) Install 'rsconnect' `install.packages('rsconnect')`
ii) Authorize Account
iii) Deploy

***

If you run into error messages like this:

`Error in library(...) : there is no package called ...`

Just install `install.packages()` the package `R` is asking you 
and make it available using `library()`

Wait for a few seconds... Voil√†!

Your app is up and running: `https://argosms.shinyapps.io/shiny_tutorial/` for the world to see!

### Challenge 1

in `app.R`: What is `ui`? What is `server`?

***

### Challenge 2

in `app.R`, under `sliderInput`: play with the numbers in `min` `max` `value`

then `save` and click on `Run app`. Can you see the changes?

***

### Challenge 3

Add a [widget](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html) to your app.
**Hint**: think about `input` and `output`
