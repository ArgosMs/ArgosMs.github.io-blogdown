Does your family and friends like the stories you share with them? Great!

Can you keep their attention for as long as you want by telling them the latest real -- or unreal -- experience you have ever lived? Awesome!

You are already -- or on the path to become -- an [effective](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/00197850610704534) leader.

The best leaders master the art of [storytelling](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/storytelling). They have either organically developed it over the years by listening and enjoying the opportunity to share stories with people around them. Or were formally trained to craft compelling stories by putting together the elements of narratives that generate [context](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/15/story-lines-facts) and momentum, leading to unexpected closures.

Leaders often need to convey [complex](http://old.cognitive-edge.com/wp-content/uploads/1998/09/48-Leadership---T-Stewart---Fortune.pdf) ideas in [complex](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/00251740610663027) environments. The best way to so is through talk story. Storytelling is more than an alternative to effective communication for leaders. It is also a way to i) share a [vision](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/LODJ-10-2011-0102), ii) motivate collaborators, and iii) reinforce values and beliefs in a way that listeners can easily understand and remember. 

But the reason to resort to storytelling as a means of effective communication is more than reaching explicit pre-established goals. We also need to be aware of the [ethics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-012-1454-8) of this [art](https://conversionxl.com/blog/the-science-of-storytelling-memory-motivation-and-its-impact-on-cro/). 

The main reason for the immense power that storytelling has on shaping experiences and perceptions has to do with the way our brain retain and [remember](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131515300889) information.

Humans brains need i) emotion [connections](https://www.edutopia.org/article/neuroscience-narrative-and-memory), ii) [narrative patterns](https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/jnlh.1.2-3.04nar), and iii) [sensorial reinforcements](http://www.skillsoft.com/assets/white-papers/SKL_WP_Storytelling-Video-based-Leadership-Training.pdf) to seek and store [information](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/51869823/Storytelling_as_Seeds_of_Childrens_Creativity.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1558095931&Signature=JyyClEcjE26V3YpJTf3jzb7Xpz8%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DStorytelling_The_seeds_of_children_s_cre.pdf). 

These mental maps then help us expand our understanding of new events through the i) acquisition, ii) processing, and iii) interpretation of information and experiences we will be exposed to. 

But the most memorable stories invariably include some sort of performance and very specific [techniques](https://visme.co/blog/7-storytelling-techniques-used-by-the-most-inspiring-ted-presenters/). 
In other words, effective communicators do not passively read books or just stand still in front of an audience. Leaders that are effective communicators captivate listerners' imagination to a certain extent that once the story comes to an end, it added a new mental map in our brains shifting the way we navigate in this world.
