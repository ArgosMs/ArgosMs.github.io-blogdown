My four-year-old son has asked me today the following as we were riding our bikes to his childcare:

'Dad, why is this man walking? He is *always* walking. Is this because he doesn't have a car? Is this because he can't buy a car, so he needs to walk?'

I said he must be right about all these assumptions. In a few years, however, I will add few more layers to his linear reasoning.

'Son, you might have been right about the reasons why that man walked every day instead of driving. But it could have also been the case that he was not allowed to drive, he could not have a driver's license. Also he could have been living in fear of being stopped by the police. If he were an undocumented immigrant, he could then risk being arrested for not having a driver's license and separated from his family'.

I am looking forward to listening to the follow-up questions my son will ask me in a few years when we resume this conversation.
