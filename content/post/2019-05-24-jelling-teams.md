It is time to put a small team together. Alone, or only you and your [co-founder(s)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08985626.2014.999719), you are not going [anywhere](https://www.lifehack.org/508099/how-build-the-right-team-for-your-startup). You need help. You need people with great skills that can laugh at themselves and put themselves in other people's shoes. To be clear: as the lighthouse of your enterprise, your main task is not only putting smart people together, you need to make them work as a team.

You have now secured some funding to 'hire' some people to grow your business. The first thing you would be looking at is if they have the [skills](https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/5-steps-for-building-a-great-startup-team.html) you are looking for. If so, then you will [test](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshsteimle/2014/01/14/how-to-build-your-startup-team-from-scratch/#17f0896f2630) their productivity ('Do they get things done?'), the quality of their work ('Is this more than I expected?') and their emotional intelligence to gauge their ability to communicate [effectively](https://fi.co/insight/how-to-build-an-all-star-startup-team) and relate to team members (and customers). 

The type of relationships you are expecting to emanate from these interactions is the one that allows team members to be themselves. You want to ensure that they are holding nothing back, that everyone enjoys the opportunity to participate, be heard, and considered before decisions are finally made. 

To jell team members even better, it is important that they understand their roles and how their work fits into the company's [mission](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/290811). People want to be part of something that is bigger than themselves. They want to feel that their contribution matters and is appreciated to the positve footprint left on markets and communities. 

But once again everything starts from you and your co-founders, mainly at these early stages. Your leadership is constantly scrutinized and hence it serves as the basis for the [norms](https://theaxelagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/What-Google-Learned-From-Its-Quest-to-Build-the-Perfect-Team.pdf) that spontaneously emerge and govern relationships within the boundaries of your company. For instance, if you and your co-founder get along with team members, it is likely that a set of behaviors that faciliates communication and foster [empathy](https://timreview.ca/article/567) will be solidified within professional practices.

If you keep remembering that everybody who applied and [accepted](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-build-better-startup-team) to join forces with you are vital parts of this evolving organism, your chances of not [failing](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-08738-2_3) and enjoy this bumpy journey increases exponentially. 

You are building after all more than a robot welded by different amazing parts. You are creating something that grows organically and is unpredictable. You reduce uncertainty around this living organism by steering it towards safe and promising land.
