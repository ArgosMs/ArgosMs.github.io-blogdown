[*Linda Liukas*](https://www.ted.com/talks/linda_liukas_a_delightful_way_to_teach_kids_about_computers/transcript?language=en): ‘And that is how programming started for me. It started as a means of self-expression.’

This blog has two goals. First, advocate the transformation of college students into [citizen developers](https://readwrite.com/2013/07/15/the-rise-of-the-citizen-developer/). Second, ‘sell’ programming to college administrators so that students from all majors can be trained to effectively used this skill before and after graduation.

I have been teaching at the tertiary level for five years now. Aussie and US students share a common habit. They nonchalantly browse their phone [screens](https://media.giphy.com/media/1IDqrFySO6y1a/giphy.gif) while waiting for the class to start. I am not pointing fingers here. I am not saying that students are expected to behave rather excitedly for a course that may have kicked them out of bed at six am. College classes are certainly not like concerts. But maybe they could arise a bit of expectation and more of a positive vibe, right? Imagine a classroom where students enthusiastically show up, even early in the morning, to share their latest [progress](https://media.giphy.com/media/ddQgUebzqXwxtBZqJE/giphy.gif) or reach out a classmate to ask a question about how she thinks an issue could be solved. This may sound detached from our current reality but should certainly not in this era of unprecedented communication technology breakthroughs. The current generation of college students grew up around web applications. These programs are second nature to them. Imagine then if they become less as of passive users of the web and more of an active, controllers- and creators-type, of the gadgets they devote so much time to. I mean, imagine you, instructor, feeling a bit sleepy while stepping into the classroom just to find students effusively chatting about the latest widget they have added to their app and how cool it looks. This is a very possible scenario for us to witness in the very near future if we [incorporate](https://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2018.1436999) packages like [Shiny](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-interactive-presentations-with-shiny-and-r/why-use-shiny) in introductory courses for these inquisitive freshman minds. The earlier [organizations](https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-shiny-course/basics/) adopting this approach will be the ones setting the tone of this silently -- I mean, active and exciting classroom -- leadership revolution.

I understand that programming has been historically associated with statistics and computer science. *R*, for instance, was originally designed by [statisticians](https://statfr.blogspot.com/2018/08/r-generation-story-of-statistical.html). I, myself, became interested in programming because I needed a more flexible software to design the output of statistical models. However, the strength of this correlation needs to be reviewed, particularly now with a growing number of open-source [packages](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) featuring much more user-friendly [interfaces](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/r-programming/introduction-to-swirl-QLz9h) (and online [tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-web-applications-in-r-with-shiny)). What I am saying here is that students with no prior knowledge of any sort of programming languages should also be invited to join the confined world of computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, engineers and the like. Students from every major can contribute to the development of current [packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html) and find innovative ways to use them that are beyond our imagination. For that, though, we need to give students the opportunity to attend introductory programming courses so that they can start envisioning the infinite possibilities offered by open-source enterprises in terms of increasing [collaboration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) and improving productivity based on [proven practices](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/proven-practices-process-stan-garfield). There are certainly several bureaucratic and teaching [challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298786680_Web_Application_Teaching_Tools_for_Statistics_Using_R_and_Shiny) to be addressed before this vision can be fully materialized. For instance, many of the administrators and heads of tertiary departments still live in the [1990s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOO31qFmi9A&t=188s). These organizational roadblocks, however, should not justify lack of experimental [initiatives](https://iase-web.org/icots/10/proceedings/pdfs/ICOTS10_9D2.pdf) and planning to [empower](https://stat.psu.edu/news/shiny-app-showcase) college students with a skill that will make them more [analytical](https://www.youngwonks.com/blog/Improving-Critical-Thinking-through-Coding) and [active](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/) members in their communities. 

The leaders of the next decades will be communicating and managing their projects interactively, lively, and on the web. More specifically, *avant-garde* project managers will have their teams focus on gaining [insights](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny-2/) from data and providing [tailored solutions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stop-using-excel-finance-chiefs-tell-staffs-1511346601) to stakeholders. But if you are skeptical, or need some evidence of this silent giant wave, check this small sample of [projects](https://www.showmeshiny.com/) to have a glimpse of how the world will be shaped by those equipped with programming language skills.
