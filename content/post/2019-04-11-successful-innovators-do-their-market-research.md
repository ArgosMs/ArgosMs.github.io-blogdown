You have a great idea: sweet! Now you need to [validate](https://medium.com/startup-grind/what-does-market-research-for-a-startup-actually-look-like-7eb5c0b31a24) it. But how? Get a pen and a piece of paper and [head out](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2379298116683215). Talk to people.

Some innovators, after having their 'wow' moment, rush to Google to find whether anyone has had the same idea before. In most cases these 'wow' ideas have i) already been implemented or ii) been tried out but not yet become a reality. 

But the problem of googling 'wow ideas' is that aspiring innovators often end up spending too much time looking up for secondary sources to validate the value and originality of their thoughts. There is a better alternative to it. 

Talk to random [people](https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-conduct-a-market-research-survey-for-your-product-idea-d048dc080259) on the streets. Assuming that you have some notion of i) what the product looks like, ii) the reasons why people need this, and iii) how the users/clients of this product will use it, it is time to approach and ask a large number of people from different demographic [groups](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11365-016-0411-x) about the concept of this product. You do so to i) test your assumptions, ii) identify your target audience, and iii) gain insights into the built-in features for the product you are planning to develop.

You stop [market research](https://productcoalition.com/the-entrepreneurs-ultimate-guide-to-market-research-6519bf1aab13) when patterns are established. You may, however, need to conduct another round of questions if you are making some significant changes to the design of the [product](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jpim.12236). The feedback you get from random people is gold because they are mostly unbiased. By taking notes of honest feedback, you are i) speeding up the development of your product while ii) reducing the risks of wasting valuable resources down the line.

The beauty of this type of no-frills market research technique is that it is easy, cheap and convenient. [Anyone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314000730) can do it. Nonetheless, it may be the case that, once you have identified your target audience, the continuous process of validating your product would better go through a set of questions asked to specific online groups. These groups congregrating 'experts' in the field of your product line will provide you with a great deal of details for you to incorporate in the newest version of your product development.

Market research, therefore, is a never ending [process](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-017-9978-z). It can certainly be done in many differents [ways](https://medium.com/swlh/startup-business-plan-market-research-f5470b196fee). But if you have a pen and a piece of paper you are good to go. After all you want to make decisions on investing your valuable resources based on [primary](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Van_Bossuyt/publication/264975052_Toward_a_Market-Based_Lean_Startup_Product_Design_Method_for_the_Developing_World/links/54be74bb0cf218d4a16a62eb.pdf) data not on secondary ones: opinions collected in different contexts and times.

Follow this [guide](https://designabetterbusiness.com/2017/10/12/how-to-really-understand-your-customer-with-the-value-proposition-canvas/) to get started in finding value for your amazing idea. And remember, it is the primary data that you have collected that define success and failure of your product development, not Google or even your own thoughts!
