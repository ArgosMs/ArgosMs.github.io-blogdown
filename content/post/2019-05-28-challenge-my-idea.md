Mentors tell where you are wrong. They make you think. They make you uncomfortable. They help your idea gain [traction](https://medium.com/@yegg/78-takeaways-from-traction-book-1b44d2a03dda) and succeed.

Entrepreneurs need [mentors](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107179190000700304).

They also provide an overview of the [gaps](https://medium.com/@Rubik.Hub/how-do-you-choose-the-right-mentor-for-your-startup-4bef3c0c868f) in your action plan and how to fill these gaps. 

The best mentor is the one who has a track record of getting things done. You will more easily trust mentors' advice if you know that they have been where you are and circumvented a similar problem you are now dealing with. 

CEOs of successful companies usually make great [mentors](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-taking-google-taught-me-startup-traction-gabriel-weinberg?articleId=6058636276532289536#comments-6058636276532289536&trk=public_profile_post).

Mentorship from these leaders is also valuale because they may refer your company to their [network](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=UWNaDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA58&dq=mentorship+startup&ots=qqaoh3WIm_&sig=pmiBcw_KYHTFuWLOmG-Oi9qcefw#v=onepage&q=mentorship%20startup&f=false) of investors and business partners. This type of mentorship also adds [credibility](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6240/1196) to your enterprise.

They may also not. If you are lucky enough to get free mentorship from an experienced leader/innovator, you will also need to apply some critical thinking to challenge [assumptions](http://www.knsecure.com/Resources/Articles/Defining%20Characteristics%20Among%20Startup%20Assistance%20Organizations.pdf) behind the statements made by your mentor. It is not always correct to assume that what worked for your [mentor](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d) will work for your [company](http://www.innovationecosystems.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TIMReview_June2016.pdf#page=24). You need to be smart to know when you should listen to your mentor or go with your gut.

Nonetheless, mentorship is an essential component of [success](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/academics/conferences/anand-gopal.pdf). This is a key pillar of the [environment](http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/99434) your business needs to be part of to [succeed](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Issue%20Brief%204%20Accelerators%20FINAL.pdf). The challenge then is i) finding the right mentorship, i) convince this person to mentor you, and iii) filter out what you do not need.

This first step will save you time and increase your chances of benefitting from mentorship that will take your idea to the next level.
