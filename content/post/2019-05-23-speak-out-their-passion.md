Innovators [share](https://search.proquest.com/docview/1678629553?pq-origsite=gscholar) their [stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjapPH6wyGA). They share their **personal** stories with **passion**. And they follow a [**script**](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137507686_10) when pitching them.

*First*, they introduce themselves and say where they come from. 

*Second*, they briefly explain why they care **so much** about the problem they are trying to solve. This involves i) pointing out the causes and effects of the problem, ii) acknowledging assumptions or initial understandings, and iii) how this problem directly affects them and their community.

*Third*, they walk the talk. They show what they have done. In this process, they explain which actions have partially worked or completely failed. This conveys to the audience their determination, perseverance, and creativity.

*Fourth*, they present which action has finally worked, why, and how this solution has changed the way they see the problem. Here presenters also share how this solution has positively affected their community.

*Fifth*, they show to the audience that their solution has drawn attention from their community and that they have shared their 'invention' with people facing similar challenges.

*Sixth*, they present what they have achieved so far and what they plan to achieve in the near future if they are given more chances to pursue their passion.

Congrats! You have found support for your idea because of you have worked hard to cause a very good first [impression](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10528008.2015.1091660).

As far as style is concerned, innovators speak out clearly and slowly. There is no repetition or redudancy in their sentences. The audience senses that the presentation was [well-planned](https://blog.toggl.com/elevator-pitch-examples/) and practiced a number of times beforehand: the presenter is not improvising or wasting their time. 

There is logical [progression](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_bodekaer_this_virtual_lab_will_revolutionize_science_class?language=en#t-337227) and each idea introduced serves as a building block to what follows immediately afterwards. In the transition of these ideas, skilled presenters add suspense and funny passages to keep the audience curious and relaxed. 

Finally, presenters pitching their ideas may use visual aids or even arrange some quick live demonstration of their solution to the audience. As a closing note, they show themselves open to the audience to approach them if they wish to.

There are also many good [tutorials](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/12/04/6-tips-for-putting-together-the-best-elevator-pitch.html) on how to pitch ideas to [investors](https://www.thinklions.com/blog/the-best-pitch-decks-weve-ever-seen/). I recommend this [one](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-design-a-better-pitch-deck/) and its [template](https://blog.ycombinator.com/intro-to-the-yc-seed-deck/) if you aim to get the attention of busy investors in a competitive environment. And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfpTCFNoa6w) is an example that illustrates the lessons learned from the previous slides.

And [here](https://piktochart.com/blog/startup-pitch-decks-what-you-can-learn/) you find the original pitch decks of some tech companies such as Facebook and AirBnB. Finally I would like to add that pitching to investors do not need to be anything fancy or glamorous as long as it includes all the elements for putting together a compelling story. Check these ones: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6O98o2FRHw), [2](https://timberry.bplans.com/video-example-of-a-great-elevator-pitch/), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvjPzsLIyGw), for instance.
