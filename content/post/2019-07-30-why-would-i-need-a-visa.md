The world is my [home](https://www.counterfire.org/articles/opinion/19151-the-politics-of-immigration). I am very happy to [work](https://www.economist.com/the-world-if/2017/07/13/a-world-of-free-movement-would-be-78-trillion-richer), [study](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/12/20/un-director-general-calls-migration-right-world-move/) or just [visit](https://www.iwm.at/transit-online/in-defence-of-free-movement/) any part of the globe, any time I want. It is great to travel [freely](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3zuhBgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA169&dq=%22global+free+movement%22+&ots=Ir7dhisxD2&sig=Lgjjw31962D6wELhLVOIC5qfnOs#v=onepage&q=%22free%20movement%22&f=false), meet people on the road, be or stay wherever I feel like. My mother, however, said, that it has not [always](https://newint.org/blog/2017/11/29/why-open-borders) been like [this](https://novaramedia.com/2018/04/23/5-reasons-global-free-movement-isnt-such-a-bad-idea/). In the old days, most people needed a [permission](https://medium.com/futuristone/your-passport-please-oh-sorry-54714639556e) called ‘visa’ to travel around. I find this very weird. Why would anyone need a [permission](https://medium.com/@rafiimran/a-world-without-visas-what-could-change-ffe675c4008f) to move across your home? to pay for a ‘permission’ so that they could work or study? to have a good time enjoying all the beauties around us? My mother said that the story behind these so-called [‘visas’](https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/resources/case-global-free-movement) are [complicated](https://iai.tv/video/beyond-borders) but at the bottom of it are: [control](https://theintercept.com/2019/07/25/ice-surveillance-ruse-arrests-raids/) and [fear](http://www.opennetwork.net/case-freedom-movement/). Some people once believed that by attempting to control those [‘different’](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/58685) people entering in their countries, they would live safer and better. This is even weirder to me.

I am a [global](https://books.google.com/books?id=-dOVSBNAsQUC&pg=PA640&lpg=PA640&dq=%22a+world+without+visas%22&source=bl&ots=C3DQVwI5LG&sig=ACfU3U2T-FNJ0N0ETvO470rXTSSo_uWNAg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-0YaQytrjAhVJ-6wKHSMAA1gQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22a%20world%20without%20visas%22&f=false) [citizen](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/england-has-fired-the-first-shot_b_10654088). My parents were born in different countries. They speak different languages. They eat different food, listen to different music. But they love these differences, they love each other. I love them exactly because they are so different and special in their own ways. The same goes for all my friends. We play [together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODLg_00f9BE) even when we have no clue of what we are saying. This is when we laugh the loudest. We are always teaching each other some cool things. It is often the case that our parents cannot understand what we are talking about. We love it. My friends and I also build our own special world: a place where we reign, feel safe, and have lots of fun. 

My friends and I [never](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-008-9033-6) applied for a ‘visa’ to travel around. Whenever we feel like traveling, we pack our bags and get in the car, train or plane, and [go](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Veit_Bader/publication/228046404_The_Ethics_of_Immigration/links/5c4ec1c592851c22a395e1eb/The-Ethics-of-Immigration.pdf). We have never paid anyone so that we could work or study. This does not make any sense. Why would anyone pay to work? Should I pay to be allowed to study? This is [crazy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315132501)! Why would some people fear neighbors that look different from them? I cannot understand it, really! It is just amazing to eat different food, listen to different music, play different sports, learn different things - [every day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuKzq9EDt-0) I am sad that the old generations lived in fear. I feel sorry for them, for all the opportunities and experiences they missed out by trying to be away from people they were made believe were ‘different’ from them. 

I must run now. Time to try something yummy - and different - with my friends. Cheers,
