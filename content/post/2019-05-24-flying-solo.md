Great, you have a [product](https://blog.ezclocker.com/choosing-a-cofounder/)! Now you need to decide: are you going solo or picking a co-founder(s)?

It is your call. But bear in mind that this decision is [crucial](https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/founders-dilemmas-anticipating-and-avoiding-pitfalls-can-sink-startup-kauffman). It will either let you take off like a rocket or sink like an anchor. You may also drown all alone if you erroneously assume you are better off going solo. 

So the first thing you need to do is to ask yourself the following: Okay, I have validated my idea, know my target audience, have tweaked my original idea, have validated it once again, generated some market interest, and have also met with some potential investors. Now it is time to decide. I have done this all alone. Do I need someone [else](http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/02/how-to-choose-co-founder.html) now? If so, why?

Let's just focus on the [advantages](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2017/12/18/how-to-choose-a-co-founder-who-will-help-you-thrive-as-an-entrepreneur/#4d843b6c11e5) of having a co-founder(s). After all, the point here is to help you figure out whether formalizing the establishiment of a company with another person is worth the risk. The questions below then aim to help you clear up a bit of your doubts and concerns before approaching someone to be a co-founder.

i) What skills am I lacking and are essential to the success of this enterprise? 

ii) Do I need a co-founder with a particular set of skills or these skills could be hired at a later stage of product development?

iii) What else does a co-founder bring to the table: Resources? Marketing Strategies? Management? Networks? Professionalism? Positive Image? Sense of Humor?

iv) Would I enjoy spending a lot of time talking about product development, management, and customer service with this person?

v) Does this person get things done? Is committed? Is trustful? Share the same vision? Will have my back?

These are only [few](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140711101112-12534154-how-to-choose-a-co-founder-for-your-startup) initial questions to help start thinking about whether you need a co-founder(s). And if so, where you should start [looking at](https://heymama.co/how-to-choose-a-co-founder/). 

Everything starts from within. Essentially the more you know about you, the more you know where you suck and where you thrive. Your [co-founder](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1604653) will be the person that thrives where you suck and sucks where you thrive. 

You do not need a [mirror](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-30424-3_5) as a business partner. However, this business partner(s) must be aligned with the core [standards and expectations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ijmr.12055) you set for yourself and the company you so dearly want to witness gaining shape and form. 

So what are your standards? What are your expectations? Can you find someone completely different than you who get and [commit](https://www.girlboss.com/work/how-to-choose-cofounder) to these standards and expectations? 

This decision might be the most difficult one you will ever make at this [early](https://ojs.sijm.it/index.php/sinergie/article/view/101) stage of your enterprise. And it will either help you touch the moon or reach the deep bottom in a blink.
