No more excuses. You can now create your own stunning website: easily, quickly and for free! 

It is also fun, believe me.

These are some [examples](https://uicard.io/blog/10-best-hugo-themes-2018/) of the websites you can create.

[Blogdown](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown/) helps you with that. If you have an hour to spare, watch this [video](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-blogdown/). It is okay if you skip it for now, though.

Blogdown is only two years old but many people have fallen in love with it. Your are the next!

There are already some great tutorials for beginners, so there is no need to start a new one. Among those, I highly recommend this one by [Peter Baumgartner](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/tutorial/blogdown-tutorial-part-1/).

Peter made a great effort to add a number of images and simple instructions to guide you every step of the way. Cheers, Peter!

Read **carefully** every instruction that Peter gives and make sure **not** to skip any of them. If you follow Peter's steps closely, you should have your website up and running in less than an hour -- while also learning tons of good stuff. 

The only observation I have to make on Peter's tutorial is on item `6` of [Part 1](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/tutorial/blogdown-tutorial-part-1/). Here Peter recommends you to use this:
`https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic.git`. I would suggest you to use this instead: `gcushen/hugo-academic`.

My final recommendation is that you pay close attention to the instructions that Peter gives in the item `4` of [Part 2](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/tutorial/blogdown-tutorial-part-2/). Take your time reading the two sections of the book he recommends here.

So after taking these steps you should now have your website live to the entire planet to see. Give yourself a big pat on the back!

[Track](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) who views your super cool website.

### Challenge 3

Create a new folder in the side menu bar of your homepage and add a new post in there. [**Hint**](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/hugo-directory-structure/): this about these key words `section` `static page` `content` `_index.md`
