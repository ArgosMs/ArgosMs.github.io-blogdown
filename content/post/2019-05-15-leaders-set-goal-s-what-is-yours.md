Leaders set [goal(s)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamcraig/2018/11/06/10-leadership-tips-for-setting-goals-and-objectives/#29c878f7763d). Clear goals provide direction to the people working with leaders. It is the meaning of these goals that give credibility to leaders and motivate people to collaborate. Leaders without goals do not lead to changes. 

The main question then is how do leaders set their goals? There are many contextual factors that play a role in determing the goal(s) that leaders decide to pursue. This can be motivated by personal [experiences](http://www.prodaio.com/uploads/1/1/4/8/11482976/the_leadership_advantage_-_warren_bennis.pdf) shaping the perception of a problem or by [priorities](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/09578230510625647) to be addressed by people placed in a particular organization. These factors thus vary to a large extent and they are very important to be considered in leadership training because a clear goal turns into a vision that is shared and nurtured with collaborators.

Let's break down then three factors that benefit from clear goals set by leaders.

[Efficiency](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1046496495264002): Individuals that show commitment to their own personal and/or organizational goals are more likely to emerge as leaders from within a group. This emergence is a key factor to make a group of collaborators work more efficiently.

[Collaborators](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/ame.1991.4274679): Individuals that set goals attract collaborators more easily because their determination to change a situation resonates with a particular target group. 

[Communication](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amle.2010.0149): Leaders that have goal(s) and passionately work towards them are more likely to enjoy better relationships with collaborators. This is because goals help collaborators identify the values and beliefs behind a certain goal and whether these values and beliefs are aligned with their own.

Thus setting goals is an essential aspect of leadership. What is yours? Use this [exercise](file:///C:/Users/NewUser/Downloads/Lakein%20Goal-Setting%20Exercise.pdf) as a starting point.
