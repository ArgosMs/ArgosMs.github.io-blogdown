Everthing starts with an [idea](https://articles.bplans.com/whats-difference-small-business-venture-startup/). And the clearer this idea, the more likely it will lead to [success](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/caim.12175). But the task of [clarifying](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-ideation-and-how-to-prepare-for-ideation-sessions) an idea is not straighforward. It requires deep thinking, self-awareness, and constructive [feedback](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923474813000647).

So, you have an idea? Great! Now think about i) what makes it important and ii) who are the people that will benefit from the solution you are proposing. More importantly, think about the problem itself. Why does this problem matter? Who wants this problem resolved? Why do they want to address this issue?

This initial stage requires an [open mind](https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking). As important as asking questions that lead to the answers you want to hear, you also need to ask questions that may reduce the sense of [urgency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV9QS1WbvqA) in addressing this problem in the first place. For instance, why is this problem not important? Why nobody or only very few people care about reducing the risk caused by this problem? Do people think this problem is really a problem?

By playing the devil's advocate of your own idea, you are testing the [relevance](https://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2014/8/5/its-time-to-fail) of the main problem you are planning to address but also reducing the chances that your own cognitive [biases](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jpim.12163) are preventing you from mapping out the complexity of tackling such an issue.

Once you have challenged your own [assumptions](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-design-thinking-and-why-is-it-so-popular) about this problem, you need to get [outside](https://libjournals.mtsu.edu/index.php/jsbs/article/view/191) and start asking people what they think about this issue. At this stage, you want to know if random people care about this problem as much as you do: why and why not. 

The main benefits of this exploratory [phase](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pmj.21577) is that i) it could save you valuable [resources](https://johnnymakes.co/why-im-building-20-startups-in-a-year/) by killing the 'once amazing' idea [outright](https://enterprisersproject.com/sites/default/files/design_thinking_comes_of_age.pdf) but ii) it could also show you further [aspects](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/SL-01-2014-0004) of this problem that must be considered so that you can come up with a better [solution](https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2013/12/16/what-is-a-startup/#6ebc996d4044). 

There is not a clear number of how many people you should be approaching for feedback on the problem you are willing to tackle. A good indicator is when the variety of the answers stop growing which signals that most of the opinions have been collected at this initial stage of challenging your own thoughts.

This [exercise](https://blog.thetin.net/post/2017/10/29/creative-concepts-and-ideation-what-s-the-big-idea) helps you gain more clarity around the problem you are so passionate about.
