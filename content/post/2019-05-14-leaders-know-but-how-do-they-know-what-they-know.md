Leaders know. They know what their strengths and weaknesses are. Leaders are aware of their powers and also of their flaws. [Self-awareness](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/hr/self-awareness-essence-effective-leadership) warns them when they should step in and out of a situation.

Thus leaders *know* because they are self-aware not because they are necessarily [knowledgeable](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Yl8YndoclYYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA229&dq=leadership+self-awareness&ots=yyY3fe95FU&sig=aL81dRWn6fYdga-UTv-3YlqcJhs#v=onepage&q=leadership%20self-awareness&f=false). Experts are respected because they know a lot about something. Leaders, instead, are respected because they care, connect, and empower regardless of the [titles and positions](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jls.20223) they hold or not. 

The people around you that [inspire](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14766080809518700?journalCode=rmsr20) you to be a better version of yourself are the true leaders. And they come in any shape and form. 

One thing that all inspirational individuals have in common is that they know who they are, they are self-aware. They tap into their strengths and work on their weaknesses. 

So the question is: *How do I know who I am?* followed by: *How can I tap into my strengths and work on my weakenesses?*

The answer to the first question was answered in a previous [blog](). Now we need to find how to be self-aware of our thoughts and acts.

There are many steps to take, like this short [article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/254669) highlights. However, i) if you think you are self-aware enough already and this makes you an effective leader, the chances are that you are neither of them, and ii) if you think of yourself as someone who needs to continue improving on the many facets of your personal traits and professional skills, it is very likely that you are already inspiring (and empowering) many people around you to be better versions of themselves.

You may also think along these lines. Should authorities be respected because of their title/position or because of what they say and how they act towards the community they are accountable to?
