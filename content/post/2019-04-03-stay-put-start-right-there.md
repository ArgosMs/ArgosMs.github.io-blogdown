It is hard to argue against. The best [place](https://www.inc.com/rahul-varshneya/3-things-to-look-for-when-deciding-where-to-start-your-startup.html) to start a business is where you find the perfect [ecosystem](https://www.cleverism.com/factors-choosing-location-startup/) to make your dream come true. This includes like-minded [people](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/290934), [community support](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericaswallow/2012/06/15/choosing-startup-location/#24b368ca37c4), [investors](https://www.bioin.or.kr/InnoDS/data/upload/policy/1310018323687.PDF) and a great coffee shop.

The problem is: if you wait to start your business until you are in the perfect [location](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/ENT-074) and [position](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1568131), you may i) start too [late](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883902614000147), ii) never start, or iii) risk of going broke before having anything meaningful to share. My suggestion then: start now, and start where you are. You can think about moving next to the best worldwide coffee shop after you have got your hands dirty and have something to show.

But there are more reasons for you staying put. First, you know your surroundings better than any online guru trying to push you their books. You know what people around you desperately need. Take advantage of that. Second, you have some [connections](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-013-9470-3). You have [friends](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30077161/Entrepreneurial_Ecosystem.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1558644954&Signature=YkKR56QjWBxXuLysHi8YQeXXkfw%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DIISTE_October_Research_Articles_Publicat.pdf) who may be able to give you a hand at the very initial stages of your enterprise. A warm long hug is always welcome when you feel a bit blue, and you will, trust me. Third, you are saving your valuable resources for the future. You are dreaming big but know that the steps to the moon start in your bedroom. So heads down and get to work.

This is not to say that the perfect location to start a business is out of bounds. You will eventually get there if you keep working hard and prove to others you deserve it. But also, think a bit more [creatively](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sajeela_Rabbani/publication/280623487_Creativity_and_Entrepreneurial_Intensions_of_Students_Moderating_role_of_Perceived_Self-Efficacy_and_Entrepreneurial_Education/links/55bf764f08ae092e9666917a.pdf#page=459): Why not make your [surroundings](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/erj.2017.7.issue-1/erj-2016-0011/erj-2016-0011.xml) the [perfect](https://yourstory.com/2012/11/book-review-startup-communities-building-an-entrepreneurial-ecosystem-in-your-city) [environment](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4a74/2468681e832e4e55e4b4f14bdf733b14ccb2.pdf) for [entrepreneurs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2473475)? Why not you become the [leader](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2393516) in this [movement](https://www.marketingfirst.co.nz/2013/04/startup-communities-building-an-entrepreneurial-ecosystem-in-your-city-by-brad-feld/)? Why not join forces with other [locals](http://smo.nl/global-start-up-communities/) sharing the same struggles and [dreams](https://ncfacanada.org/how-to-create-an-entrepreneurial-ecosystem/)? 

Act now, [stay](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0971355716650373) [together](http://www.betadergi.com/jeim/yonetim/icerik/makaleler/11-published.pdf). The coffee shop around the corner is quite comfy anyways!
