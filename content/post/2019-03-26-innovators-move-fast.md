Okay. You have shapen up your [idea](https://www.hotjar.com/blog/how-to-grow-a-startup). You know the demand for your product. You know who needs it and maybe even how much users/clients are willing to pay for it. Awesome! But this is just the beginning... Now you need to develop your product.

But wait, do not take a long deep breath thinking that this is a costly and boring process. It is not. It is actually quite straightforward and fun. Also, do not think that you need particular skill sets to build the first version of your product. You do [not](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-build-your-mvp-without-a-technical-co-founder-and-without-code-5a40bc2aeef6), believe me. If you have, again, paper and pencil, you are fine. But some [creativity](https://blog.ycombinator.com/minimum-viable-product-process/) is largely welcomed at this early stage of your product development!

So you know now that you, with the skills you already have, can build the [first](https://timreview.ca/article/535) [prototype](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33515-5_10) of your product. Start then as [soon](http://host.uniroma3.it/facolta/economia/db/materiali/insegnamenti/611_8959.pdf) as you can. Get this prototype ready as [fast](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38971773/teachLeanStrategy.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1558547254&Signature=OGHj3cKaJ%2BpCx%2BS453BhOAE0d0M%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DTeach_Lean_Strategy.pdf) as possible. Put it in the hands of your target audience as [quickly](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-44930-7_1) as your mother yells at you when she sees you have left a dirty plate on the table! 

Sometimes you do not even need something tangible for your first few [mockups](https://balsamiq.com/). Quite often you just need a short video, few slides or even few sentences to convey to the audience the concept of the product you are planning to build. The success of whatever [mockup](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/7-essential-prototyping-tools-to-use-with-sketch-c7a594f486a0) you resort to will be indicated by the quality of the feedback you get. If your users/clients are [responding](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-44930-7_9) to the mockup paper app you have designed then stick with it.

Try keeping this development [process](https://blog.ycombinator.com/product-development-cycle-fundamentals/) fun. Perhaps giving some funny names to each new version released? Numbering prototypes helps convey the notion of quickness and improvement. It also highlights the important understanding that product development is indeed a process. It is a continuous incremental improvement built upon ameliorating previous versions.

So now you have moved on from `.0` to `.11` of your [prototypes](https://blog.sketchapp.com/an-in-depth-look-at-prototyping-in-sketch-942394341f3c) in a very short span of time while saving a great deal of your [limited](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33515-5_6) resources. Congrats! This means you have had something left to pay your 'living' bills. 

Also, by testing the early versions of your product, you should then feel quite comfortable about how your users/clients feel towards your [product](https://blog.intuz.com/10-principles-to-accelerate-product-development-process/?utm_source=ycombinator). So now it is time to build the real thing. The product that will be available to your community or the [world](https://timreview.ca/sites/default/files/article_PDF/RasmussenTanev_TIMReview_November2015.pdf) to see and use it. 

But do not fear. If you reached this stage, it is very likely that you can raise some funding to build the real thing. It shows investors that you have the [grit](https://producthabits.com/how-to-build-your-startup-with-no-technical-background-or-budget/) and motivation to make this happen. But keep moving fast and do not forget to put [lines](http://www.riktamtech.com/5-tools-to-sketch-your-app-idea-before-you-hire-an-app-developer/) around your ideas.
