To explore all the power that `R` offers, you must learn the basics. This learning process can be boring to learn and teach. However, both experiences have become much easier in recent years because of the great efforts of people like Garrett Grolemund, who has written [books](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) and created [apps](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/04-Programming-Basics/#section-welcome) that help students quickly and effortlessly grasp the basic steps of programming in `R`. 

I highly recommend both: the book and the app hyperlinked to get you started in the fantastic world of `R`.

Enjoy the trip!
