[Conflict resolution](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/conflict-resolution/what-is-conflict-resolution-and-how-does-it-work/) is one, if not the main one, of the main challenges leaders face on a daily basis. And the probem is that conflicts come from everywhere and all types of forms and shapes. To make maters worse, many of these conflicts are [unexpected](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5841/1039) and require immediate action to avoid them to escalate and lead to negative outcomes.

Successful leaders are trained to effectively manage conflicts. Essentially they combine communication and analytical skills. The communication skills have to do with their emotional and [personal](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/02621710510584026) skills. Analytical skills are observed when leaders look for [facts](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00289432) and further details and opinions when mediating conflicts.

Effective leaders also understand the complexity of conflicts and their resolutions. There is not a single or best solution that fits all conflicts. This is because every conflict involves such a number of interests and factors that leaders need to resort to their [creativity](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3845&context=sol_research) and adaptability to ensure that a resolution adequately suits the problem in question.

Thus leaders need to be prepared. They need not only learn from their experiences and mistakes but also pick up new techniques that strengthen their [management](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_81.htm) skills. The management of conflicts, however, depends of decision making. Leaders aware of how they make their [decisions](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0149-0508.00035) and the flaws in these processes are more likely to avoid bias and find a neutral position when bringing antagonizing parties to reach an agreement.

Therefore leaders that enjoy the ability to anticipate, mitigate, and manage conflicts are those that are constantly seeking new ways to know and challenge themselves with new ideas and methods. The best leaders turn conflicts into [opportunities](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/job.473) because they are always learning and improving because they know that the successful resolution of conflicts depends on their ability to be creative and [adaptable](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022343308100719). 

This is an [exercise](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/crq.21227) that trains leaders in conflict resolution. And this [one](http://wilk4.com/humor/humore14.htm) is a fun set of questions to get your brain to start praticting some lateral thinking, a personal trait of adaptable and creative leaders.
