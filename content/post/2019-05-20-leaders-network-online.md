Leaders spend a great deal of time [networking](https://hbr.org/2007/01/how-leaders-create-and-use-networks). Networks provide leaders with information, guidance, and [insights](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013161X10378689). It is fair to say that effective leaders are experts in [strengthening](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984310000901) and expanding their networks to make better decisions.

Leaders understand that leadership is [relational](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-12426-001). Leadership depends on the relationships one has or has nurtured with peers. These relationships are key because they open up opportunities and signal risky paths.

The challenge is that strengthening and expanding professional relationships demand time. Effective leaders spend a significant amount of their resources connecting and reconnecting with their peers in order to learn something new or [share](https://www.ccl.org/blog/top-6-rules-leadership-networking/) some information they deem important to foster a partnership. 

The relational nature of leadership, however, does not need to be perceived as burdensome. Current [technology](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2014.0562) allows leaders to communicate and build trust with professionals they have never met in person. These digital technologies have also significantly reduced the cost of planning and maintaining strategic relationships. 

Thus the role that physical presence plays, despite being still largely important, has diminished over the years for building long-term partnerships. Nowadays people can build and invest in their professional relationships by effectivey [communicating](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/PMR1530-9576330102) and [collaborating](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/41166121) online with peers. 

It is those individuals mastering the art of building and strengthening [relationships](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226470), mainly [virtually](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JMP-10-2013-0344), that exert the most effective type of [leadership](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2016/08/19/how-to-become-a-thought-leader/#5a66bc503353) in the current era of communication [breakthroughs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2011.00866.x). This happens because these emerging leaders are focused on exercizing leadership through [connections](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-98062-1_5), not structures.

[Here](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/298262) you find an interesting reading for becoming a 'butterfly' online leader. And [here](https://www.ccl.org/blog/leadership-development-canvas/) some structure to organize your thoughts before reaching out those people that you can help and can help you.
