If you have a chance to live in Japan, look no further than [Takanabe](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=en&mid=1e4k3JRGM47Ohv7DQFYAluu4YYntLssZb&ll=32.13814356120253%2C131.49293899999998&z=13), Miyazaki. This is a small coast town, half an hour by train to Miyazaki City, that offers amazing beaches, temples, restaurants, schools and mountains. Kids play on the street and there are plenty of community activities all year round. This is alse o where the wiz kid [Sky Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e_dnSMEPQw) and her brother, Ocean, were raised and honed their riding skills while enjoying their superb lifetsyle. Be stoked!
