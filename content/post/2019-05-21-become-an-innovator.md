This the perfect [time](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/00251741211194921) to [innovate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NugRZGDbPFU). Anyone can change the ways things are done. For that, though, you will need the right [skills](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/14601060810845268) to polish your idea and reach out [collaborators](https://voxeu.org/content/where-does-innovation-come).

[Communication technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898589807000575) allow aspiring innovators to pursue their [passion](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-3803-7_52). Individuals who want to change the [pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SVm_GuYT2A) of certain [practices](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JSTP-02-2014-0028) can find now [like-minded](https://medium.com/globalonlineacademy/vision-action-reflection-using-online-spaces-for-professional-learning-4fc3e7b9a6ec) people with only few clicks. 

Aspiring innovators need to make their concerns and ideas available [online](https://memeburn.com/2014/09/6-online-spaces-where-you-should-be-growing-your-presence/). By making ideas and concerns public, innovators let the world know who they are as well as the status of their [ideas](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-22389-6_13). This online step also allows innovators to be found by [individuals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0276146708325382) who seek opportunities to collaborate with [projects](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-016-9483-z) that are tackling problems they [care about](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/10748121111107672?fullSc=1).

Innovators live on [momentum and synergy](https://www.emailout.com/maintain-startup-momentum/). The ability to connect with people [online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207540701224582) and in the [real](https://www.nuiteq.com/company/blog/characteristics-of-innovative-learning-spaces-that-you-should-know) world is that keep this energy up and running. However, the first step to create this momentum is defining the problem you, or your team, will be tackling.

Clarity around the definition, relevance and recommended [solutions](http://pedrotrillo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Whatisdisruptiveinnovation.pdf) for the problem to be tackled is critical to create momentum around an idea. Collaborators, advisors, investors, they all want to know if you can explain in few words the 'what, why and how' [questions](https://www.score.org/blog/elevator-pitch-what-why-and-how) about the problem you are interested in. 

Successful innovators can quickly [pitch](http://www.mrgriffin.org/FHSWEB/ENT/articles/ThePerfectElevatorPitch.pdf) their ideas and easily get their message across. Nonetheless, the process to get to this stage requires planning, [thinking](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238545) and many [iterations](https://search.proquest.com/openview/24ef056270cbe1f56d751ef5807a26ac/1?cbl=47961&pq-origsite=gscholar). A perfect pitch does not come to life overnight! 

These labs on innovation, therefore, will help you polish your ideas and help you strategically think how you can find, connect and work with people that will help you turn your idea into reality. 

This [exercise](https://www.creatlr.com/template/TAyVOS99Dq2hPirLHm5jsh/elevator-pitch-canvas/) will set you on the right path to start thinking about your pitch!
