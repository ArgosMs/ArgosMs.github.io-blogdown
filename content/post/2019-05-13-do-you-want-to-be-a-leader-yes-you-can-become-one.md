You can be more than a skilled programmer or a deep thinker. You can also be a leader, if you want to become one. This journey starts by learning what makes you tick.

The objective of this first blog on simple techniques to become a leader starts with my definition for leadership. I feel quite comfortable stating my own definition here as nobody has the monopoly over what [leadership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18UVXW-x2_8) really is and how we should go about it. 

So here is mine:

> Leader is someone who *believes* in something. And *know* that to *achieve* this something, s/he *needs* support.

Let's break down the four words highlighted. If a person (or a group of people) *believes* (or understands) that a situation needs to change because of their *knowledge* (or perception) of that particular situation, they start mobilizing resources to *achieve* (or reach) this goal. However, the mobilization of these resources will only lead to changes if the leader (or leaders) is aware that s/he *need* (have to) to work (collaborate) with other people.

So the first word highlighted in the definition above was: *believe*. Let's focus on it.

*Belief* is about i) who you are and ii) how you think you are who you are or should be. (This is also my own definition by the way.) However, knowing who you are (or should be) is rather a [complex](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/how-beliefs-about-the-self-shape-personality-and-behavior) topic that could easily make this post become a thousands words book. As this is not the intent here, I will focus on the first aspect of the definition provided.

Knowing who you are is the starting point of leadership training. You need to know **what** and **why** you care about something, and be happy or deeply upset about it, to start thinking about changing the situation you, or others, are in. This short [video](https://www.psychalive.org/finding-yourself/) provides a nice introduction to it, despite its simplistic dichotomy between negative and positive experiences and the framing of individuals as single entities. 

Nevertheless, the point is: it is important that you find ways to know i) who you are, i) what you want, and iii) why you want it, if you want to have a better understanding of what leadership is. 

A very simple way to start the investigation of who you are is filling a [reflective learning journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623940600837517) with words that reveal not only the present but also how your [memory](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/72A3-8UPY-GDB9-GX9K) influences your decisions based on the past events and emotions that you can remember (or have been reinforced or deliberately supressed either by you or someone else within your network).

So get your pen, start reflecting, and writing to find who you are! Enjoy the journey of figuring out what makes you tick!
