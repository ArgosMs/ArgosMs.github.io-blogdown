Anyone, interested but frightened, can learn programming, especially the supposedly [steep learning curve](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rlanguage/comments/979ebq/why_do_people_say_r_has_a_steep_learning_curve/) and rapidly recognized as the [*lingua franca*](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/11/the-rise-of-r-as-the-language-of-analytics.html) of data science: *R*. The main challenge of teaching [*R*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcBLEVknqvY) language to people with no programming experience is managing their fear. Preconceived assumptions dissipate when learners see that a computer can understand what they are saying. Pause here. What I mean by ‘computer can understand’ is that the very first codes that first-time programmers write must return outputs without blatant error messages. Computers, differently than humans, are unforgiven. If a student is working alone and is also a type of auditory or [kinesthetic](https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/how-to-spot-visual-auditory-and-kinesthetic-learni.html) type of learner, receiving multiple ‘error messages’ feels like a slap in the face. This upset emotion kicks in mainly because a solution for fixing these errors cannot be easily spot in the horizon, so it is very likely that it will quickly escalate to a point in which accumulated frustration -- in addition to the hopeless feeling of drowning and knowing that no one is coming for you, or listen to you because you do not know yet how to [ask](https://www.wikihow.com/Ask-a-Question-on-Stack-Overflow) for help -- will serve to reaffirm the preconception that ‘programming is not for me, it is just too difficult’. It does not need to be this way.

If ‘computers understand what students are saying’, and keep saying, first-time programmers gradually boost their confidence by taking satisfaction out of their continuous and incremental [improvement](https://qz.com/work/1183536/the-japanese-philosophy-of-kaizen-can-reinvent-your-daily-routine/). By keeping instructions short, simple and meaningful, students learn to talk R just like [young children](https://www.parenting.com/article/how-children-learn-to-talk) learn to understand the world around them and mumble their very first few words (This comparison is a bit of a stretch, I know, but it will help you get through this blog more happily at least). Little children learn by repeating behavior and codes, and grasping meaning from the environments they are put in. This can be for some old folks a meaningless and exhaustive process, but it does need to be so rigid to the point that it does not allow learners to effectively meet their basic ‘communication’ needs while also keeping them motivated enough to take risks by adding and twisting words and syntaxes in their unconscious effort to expand the number of building blocks for their [adaptive toolbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8dFWpWOZM&t=4s). This is the theoretical framework, supported by [neuro linguistic programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ZcXm3HvtA), that courses teaching programming for people who are willing to learn but afraid of writing their first lines of code should be replicating in the classroom. 

[Physical set-ups](https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/where-higher-education-and-technology-intersect-an-interview-with-kevin-guidry/) are the best format to beat language-learning frustration (and this is particularly true when students do not have yet a good command in English). First, learning *R* should not happen only through reading and writing. Nobody should be presumed to be smart or self-taught to learn anything, let alone programming. A classroom filled with motivated students is the most conducive environment to learn a new language because it also involves listening and all the other the human senses and [interactions](https://www.teachthought.com/learning/10-characteristics-of-a-highly-effective-learning-environment/). Think again about little children trying to get across their first few words. Memory and reasoning develop more effectively if the little ones are immersed in an environment where they find useful examples for their next steps, ample opportunities to take safe risks, and encouragement in the form of positive, quick, and constructive feedback. If someone learning *R* finds herself on an island without any sort of direct or emotional support, it is very likely that fishing using a tree branch might be perceived as a more rewarding -- and tasteful -- lonely experience.

So, what is exactly the methodology to teach first-time, ‘interested but frightened’, wannabe programmers? The answer consists of three main parts. First, the *environment*: it involves tangible resources such as equipped classrooms and all the amenities that make students comfortable and nudge them to collaborate while learning and playing as if they were working in a startup environment (perhaps something like [this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F54%2F9c%2Feb%2F549ceb5b1abd5787c0a33c9045456708.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F31103053657515242%2F&docid=ixVuqwJ7tPZSMM&tbnid=ewij5xkR9y030M%3A&vet=10ahUKEwiA263M-rPhAhUDZKwKHdKOA-IQMwhBKAEwAQ..i&w=3264&h=2448&bih=678&biw=1383&q=startup%20classroom%20setups&ved=0ahUKEwiA263M-rPhAhUDZKwKHdKOA-IQMwhBKAEwAQ&iact=mrc&uact=8)). In this ‘environment’, the other students are also valuable resources since they help an individual fare, compare, and relate to. Second, the *instructor*: this person, as commonly assumed, does not need to be an expert. Expertise does not mean excellence by any means. Scientists are not always excellent teachers. More importantly, instructors should be facilitators, effective communicators who deliver a program for first-time programmers with fun, relevant, and a bit of a challenging models. To achieve excellence in facilitating learning experiences, it is more important to actively listen to students’ questions so that a program can remain flexible enough to be tailored to the strengths and demands of each student. Third, the *content*: the structure and presentation of a course needs to be carefully designed -- and tested -- in a way that allows instructors to leverage the playing field by not leaving behind committed students while still allowing others to explore independent ways of learning. In this dual process, it is very important that the delivery of content keeps to a minimum the number of jargons and programming logic, at least in the very first few lessons. If a course is craftly designed and delivered, students should be expected to intuitively and gradually pick up the ‘bolts and nuts’ of *R* programming. Just like little children enjoying the experience of learning how to make their feelings and needs understood by their caring parents and caretakers (instructors) and supportive siblings and friends (classmates).

I have been a teacher, and now a facilitator, for two decades now. I started off as a language instructor, moved on to traditional academic settings, and now training the next generation of leaders with the powerful language of *R*.
