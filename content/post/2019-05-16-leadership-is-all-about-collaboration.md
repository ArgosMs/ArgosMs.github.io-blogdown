Leaders are not leaders if they act alone. Leaders are leaders if they build [relationships](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107179199700400402) with collaborators and this collaboration ends up becoming [partnerships](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/01437730010335445). Thus leadership is about improving relationships with collaborators so that collaborators eventually become partners. Leadership is partnership.

Partnership is the foundation of teamwork. Team members that see themselves as partners boost their performance and are more likely to be rewarded with overall [success](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786310000566). Thus the role of a real leader is building a team of partners. And to do so they will need to consider the [structures, processes and characteristics](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/1556343) of each collaborator so that these collaborators can strengthen relationships with team members.

Building parnerships, therefore, is not an easy or simple task. It [requires](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED535652) that leaders ensure that collaborators i) share the same vision; ii) get to know each other for trust-building; iii) feel safe to share their opinions and concerns; iv) are trained to make informed decisions; v) find all necessary support to perform their tasks; and vi) are socially and financially rewarded for their efforts.

[Experience](https://ccph.memberclicks.net/assets/Documents/FocusAreas/muj_20.2_freeman.pdf) is one reason behind leaders building sucessful partnerships. However, this is not a guarantee for success. Inexperienced individuals that understand what it takes to build meaningful relationships with other people in and out of an organizational setting can help team members become partners as effective -- or even better -- than established leaders. 

Inexperienced leaders are effective in their leadership assignments when they [plan ahead](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcop.20037) and ensure that team members can [hone](http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=1f7d78ed-da6f-43f5-b8d3-6d16d304a807%40sessionmgr103&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=37138538&db=a9h) their skills while collaborating with a collective effort.
