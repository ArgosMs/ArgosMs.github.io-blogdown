Leaders are not expected to give answers. They are instead expected to ask questions, the [right](https://hbr.org/2009/05/real-leaders-ask.html) questions. And why is that? Answers are surely important but before them questions need to be asked. This is what inspiring leaders do. 

Before rushing to make a decision, effective leaders step back from all the influences around them to assess the significance of claims and arguments presented to them. This reflective ability allows leaders to recognize and evaluate assumptions before deciding whether the information gathered is enough to make an [informed](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jls.21241) decision or whether further evidence is required to make a judgement about a particular issue. 

The journey of asking questions, however, requires [competent](https://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA123321909&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=01463934&p=AONE&sw=w) instruction and training. One approach commonly used to instill [critical thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnJ1bqXUnIM) in university students is asking them to solve complex real world [problems](https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/teaching-learning/resources/teaching-strategies/problem-based-learning-(pbl)). In this method, students are expected to individually or in group search for answers through exploratory research. This method, however, needs to adapt to [cultural](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00898.x) differences and [emotional](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicole_Stedman/publication/228410492_Identification_of_Relationships_between_Emotional_Intelligence_Skill_Critical_Thinking_Disposition_in_Undergraduate_Leadership_Students/links/0c96051657fe20cdbc000000/Identification-of-Relationships-between-Emotional-Intelligence-Skill-Critical-Thinking-Disposition-in-Undergraduate-Leadership-Students.pdf) intelligence.

This type of problem-based approach to initiate students in critical thinking has proven to lead to positive [results](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02481.x). This trend in academic settings to infuse classrooms with critical thinking training has become more important nowadays as it has been widely recognized that the next generation of leaders are required to think critically, no longer [memorize](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-5812.2010.00672.x) and recite [facts](https://search.proquest.com/openview/2cd6acb1e860476b8c162248ad8976ac/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2030483). Youth leaders are now trained to i) actively engage with their surroundings, ii) seek reliable sources, iii) compare and contrast arguments as well as iv) identify vested interests. Gaining these skills is the foundation of programs focusing on transformational learning [experiences](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/18/10/transformative-learning). 

The main benefits of being a leader with sharpen critical thinking skills are not only being able to make better decisions for yourself and encouraging collaborators to be independent [thinkers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/making-critical-thinking-a-classroom-reality/163B8481EA5000C33A82F5E7B9867DF9) but also the confidence, translated in the form of excitment, to realize that one has the ability to be [adaptable](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764293037001014) after listening to opinions and before reaching a conclusion, which is hardly ever definitive.

This is an [exercise](https://www.lavc.edu/profdev/library/docs/promotethink.aspx) to help you start working on asking questions to prompt critical thinking.
